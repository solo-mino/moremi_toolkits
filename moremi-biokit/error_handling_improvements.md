# Error Handling Improvements in the Protein Pipeline

## Overview

We've improved error handling in both the validator and ranker components to address several issues:

1. Better tracking of warnings and errors via the ProteinMetrics object
2. Providing more specific error messages for processing failures
3. Using robust exception handling with proper messaging
4. Ensuring consistent error reporting between the validator and ranker

## Key Changes

### 1. Added Warning System

- Added warning fields to `ProteinMetrics` class
- Created helper methods to add warnings in both validator and ranker:
  - `_add_warning` in ProteinValidator
  - `_add_warning_to_metrics` in ProteinRanker

### 2. Improved Category Error Handling

- Each category of metrics in the validator is now wrapped in a try-except block
- When a category fails, it is handled gracefully rather than failing the entire process
- Errors are recorded in the metrics object and missing categories are tracked

### 3. Safe Metric Value Parsing

- Added `_parse_metric_value` to safely convert string metric values to numbers
- Removed unsafe `eval()` usage in the binding affinity scoring
- Made all scoring methods safer by checking types and handling exceptions

### 4. Enhanced Warning Reporting

- Failed metrics are now tracked and reported in the final output
- Added tracking of missing categories with appropriate level of warnings
- Added critical warnings when too many metrics are missing
- Included warning count in the output DataFrame for better filtering

### 5. Detailed Error Reporting

- Added traceback information in detailed error logs
- Added separate files for detailed failure reports
- Improved error messages to include category and specific error reasons

### 6. Output Improvements

- Failed proteins are reported with structured information
- Warning summaries help identify patterns of failures
- Warning details can be included in the ranking output

## Automatic Antigen Structure Prediction

We've added the capability to automatically predict antigen structure when only a sequence is provided:

### New Features:

1. **Automatic Structure Prediction** - When only `target_antigen_sequence` is provided without a PDB file, the validator will now use `structure_predictor.predict_structure()` to generate a 3D structure

2. **New Helper Method** - Added `_predict_antigen_structure()` method that handles:
   - Setting appropriate output directories
   - Calling structure_predictor with proper parameters
   - Handling potential errors during prediction
   - Setting the predicted structure path for binding affinity calculation

3. **Improved Binding Affinity Logic** - Updated binding affinity calculation to:
   - Work seamlessly with predicted structures
   - Display clear "predicted" vs downloaded structure source information
   - Provide specific error messages about what's missing
   - Track warnings appropriately for failed predictions

### Usage:

```python
# Using only antigen sequence - structure will be predicted automatically
validator = ProteinValidator(
    pdb_files_path="output_dir",
    target_antigen_sequence="MKTVQERLKSIVRILERSKEPVSGAQLAEELSVSRQVIVQDIAYLRSL"
)

# The predicted structure will be used for binding affinity calculations
```

## Testing

We've created multiple test scripts to verify these improvements:

1. `test_error_handling.py` - Tests the warning system and errors in mock metrics
2. `test_simplified.py` - Tests the pipeline with simplified metric calculation
3. `test_antigen_structure_prediction.py` - New test script that verifies automatic structure prediction functionality

## Future Improvements

- Add additional metrics validation (e.g., check ranges, expected values)
- Implement a severity level system for warnings (critical, warning, info)
- Add an option to ignore certain warnings based on user configuration
- Consider implementing a "strict" mode that would fail on critical errors
