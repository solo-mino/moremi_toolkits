## 1. Binding Affinity (Weight: 0.30)

- Dissociation Constant (Kd): Threshold between e-3 and e-12
  - Closer to e-12 is better → Higher score.
  - Anything above e-12 → Score = 0.
  - Anything below e-3 → Score = 0.

## 2. GMQE Score (Weight: 0.20)

- Score Range: 0.6 - 1 → Higher is better (Closer to 1 gets a higher score).

## 3. Glycosylation Sites (Weight: 0.10)

- N-Glycosylation Sites Count: Range (1, 4) → Closer to 4 is better (Higher score).

## 4. Aggregation (Weight: 0.10)

- Aggregation Propensity: Categories → Low, Medium, High
  - Low is better → Higher score.
- Aggregation-Prone Regions: Range (0, 8) → Closer to 0 is better (Higher score).

## 5. ProtParam (Weight: 0.10)

- GRAVY Score: Range (-1, 0) → Closer to 0 is better (Higher score).
- Solubility: Soluble is better → Higher score.

## 6. Immunogenicity (Weight: 0.05)

- Immunogenic Score: Range (0-1) → Higher is better (Closer to 1 gets a higher score).

## 7. Conservancy (Weight: 0.05)

- Conservancy Score: Range (0-1) → Higher is better (Closer to 1 gets a higher score).

## 8. Stability (Weight: 0.05)

- Melting Temperature (Tm):
  - Tm ≤ 45°C or >= 90°C → Score = 0.
  - 40°C to 60°C → Higher is better (Closer to 60°C gets a higher score).
  - 60°C and 90°C → 1

## 9. Epitope (Weight: 0.03)

- Epitope Score: Range (0-1) → Higher is better (Closer to 1 gets a higher score).

## 10. Developability (Weight: 0.02)

- Developability Score: Range (0-1) → Higher is better (Closer to 1 gets a higher score)
