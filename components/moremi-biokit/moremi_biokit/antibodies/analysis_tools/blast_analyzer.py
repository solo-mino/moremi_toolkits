    """Perform a BLAST search on a protein sequence.

    Args:
        sequence (str): The protein sequence to search.
        database (str, optional): The BLAST database to use. Defaults to "nr".
        program (str, optional): The BLAST program to use. Defaults to "blastp".

        num_of_alignments (int, optional): The number of alignments to return.

    Returns:
        Optional[Dict[str, Any]]: A dictionary containing the BLAST results 
            (e.g., {"blast_result": [...]}) or None if an error occurs or no
