"""Antibody Analysis Tools Subpackage.

This subpackage provides various tools for analyzing antibody sequences, including:
- Sequence homology searches (BLAST)
- Physicochemical property calculation (ProtParam)
- Stability prediction
- Aggregation propensity prediction
- Glycosylation site prediction
- Structure prediction (via SWISS-MODEL)
- B-cell epitope prediction (via IEDB)
- Epitope conservancy analysis
- Developability assessment based on sequence similarity to known antibodies.
